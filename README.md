# reason in revolt

This is a new blog cloned from the old davidtrussler.net site

It has been created to contain blog entries specifically of political writings, created to separate this aspect of what I do from the more general biographical, music-related and work-based site. 

The title is based on a line from The Internationale. 

The blog will use following Front End technologies:
- HTML5 (semantic elements)
- BEM
- SASS
- requireJS
- SVG icons
- Karma, Mocha, Chai, Sinon for testing
